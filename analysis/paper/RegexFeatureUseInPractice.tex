\begin{abstract}
Regular expressions are used frequently in programming languages for form validation, ad-hoc file searches, and simple parsing. Due to the popularity and pervasive use of regular expressions, researchers have created tools to support their creation, validation, and use. Each  tool has made design decisions about which regular expression features to support, yet, there does not exist an empirical study of regular expression feature usage to inform these design decisions.

In this paper, we explore regular expression feature usage, focusing on how often features are used and the diversity of regular expressions from syntactic and semantic perspectives. To do this, we analyzed  XYZ open source Python projects from GitHub. We measure how frequently regular expressions are used and performed a feature analysis on the scraped regular expression strings. We tabulate the popularity of each feature and compare it to four common regular expression support tools. 
Our results indicate that the most commonly used regular expression features are supported by popular research tools 
 and that programmers frequently reinvent the wheel by writing identical or nearly identical regular expressions in different ways.
%These observations lead to suggestions on which regular expression features are imperative to support and for future directions in research to help developers write and reuse regular expressions.
