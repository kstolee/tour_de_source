\begin{abstract}
Regular expressions are used frequently in programming languages for form validation, ad-hoc file searches, and simple parsing. Due to the popularity and pervasive use of regular expressions, researchers have created tools to support their creation, validation, and use. Each tool has made design decisions about which regular expression features to support, and these decisions impact the usefulness of the tools and their power. Yet, these decisions are often made with little information as there does not exist an empirical study of regular expression feature usage to inform these design decisions.

In this paper, we explore regular expression feature usage, focusing on how often features are used and the diversity of regular expressions from syntactic and semantic perspectives. To do this, we analyzed nearly 4,000 open source Python projects from GitHub and extracted nearly 14,000 unique regex patterns that were used for analysis.
We also map the most common features used in regular expressions to those features supported by four common regex engines from industry and academia, brics, Hampi, Re2, and Rex.
Our results indicate that the most commonly used regular expression features are also supported by popular research tools and that programmers frequently reinvent the wheel by writing identical or nearly identical regular expressions in different ways.
We concluded by discussing the implications of omitting certain features in a tool's design and out like several directions of future work.
%FYI: nProjScanned = 3898
%These observations lead to suggestions on which regular expression features are imperative to support and for future directions in research to help developers write and reuse regular expressions.

\section{Threats to Validity}

The threats to validity of this work stem primarily from sampling bias, tool limitations, and language selection.

We mined only \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value} Python projects from GitHub, which is very small in comparison with the over 100,000 available Python projects on that platform. The projects were mined using the GitHub API which sorts the projects by creation date. By using the API, the goal was to reduce any sampling bias introduced by the researchers.

We did not scrape all commits in every project for regular expression utilizations, rather, we grabbed each project every 20 commits. It is possible that in between the scanned commits, a regular expression utilization was added and then removed, leading to fewer utilizations in our final data set.

In extracting patterns for analysis, we omit utilizations that contain flags since flags provide refinements on the functionality of the pattern as it is used in the project. Given that only 12.7\% of all utilizations used flags, the impact on the clusters should be minimal.

%The feature analysis is dependent on the features identified in the PCRE parser.

Regular expression patterns were clustered using strings generated by the Rex tool. This introduces two threats to validity. First, we assume that the strings generated by Rex are reasonably diverse to help characterize the regular expression behavior. To mitigate this threat, Rex generated at least 384 strings per regular expression. Second, since the similarity between two regular expressions was calculated empirically using Rex rather than through analysis, we may have over-estimated the similarly. For this reason, in our clustering algorithm, we require a similarity level of 0.75 so that we do not over-estimate the similarity between regular  expressions.

The final threat to validity comes from the fact that we only explore regular expressions in Python projects so these results many not generalize to other languages. Future work will replicate this study in other languages and compare the results.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Regular expressions are used frequently in programming projects. In our analysis of nearly 4,000 Python projects scraped from GitHub, we observed that over 42\% contained a regular expression. The most commonly found regular expressions deal with matching whitespace or digits.
In analyzing the features used in regular expressions, we find that the most common is the {\tt +} token.
When clustering regexes based on semantic similarity, we observe that programmers frequently create identical regular expressions using slightly different features. After mapping the features supported by four popular regex tools from academia and industry, we observe that most of the most popular features are also supported. However, those  unsupported can have an impact on the tool users.
