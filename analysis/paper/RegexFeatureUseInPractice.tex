\begin{abstract}
Regular expressions are used frequently in many programming languages for form validation,
ad-hoc file searches, and simple parsing. Many researchers have created solvers, parsers, tools and theoretical works which include a subset of the regular expression features used in practice. Yet, there does not exist an empirical study of regular expression feature usage in practice that could inform the choices that researchers are making about what features to include and exclude. In this paper, we explore feature usage in practice, focusing on how often certain excluded features are used, and what use cases are associated with what features. To do this, we analyzed about 4000 open source Python projects from GitHub and explored the regular expressions contained within. Our results indicate that \todo{high level results}
