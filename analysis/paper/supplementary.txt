Hello,

Here are the links removed from the submission:

Survey: https://github.com/softwarekitty/tour_de_source/blob/master/regex_usage_in_practice_survey.pdf

GitHub repo: https://github.com/softwarekitty/tour_de_source

Also, the company we surveyed was Dwolla, but I removed all named references to it since it's a small, Iowa-based startup that would impact anonymity. 

Thanks!
Katie
