Next, we present the results of each research question.

\subsection{RQ1: How do developers use regexes?}
\label{rq1:survey}
The survey was completed by 18 participants (82\% response rate) that identified as software developer/maintainers.
Respondents have an average of nine years of programming experience ($\sigma = 4.28$).
On average, survey participants report to compose 172 regexes per year ($\sigma$ = 250) and compose regexes on average once per month, with 28\% composing multiple regexes in a week and an additional 22\% composing regexes once per week. That is, 50\% of respondents uses regexes at least weekly.
Table~\ref{tab:regexenviron} shows how frequently participants compose regexes using each of several languages and technical environments.
Six (33\%) of the survey participants report to compose regexes using general purpose programming languages (e.g., Java, C, C\#) 1-5 times per year and five (28\%) do this 6-10 times per year.  For command line usage in tools such as grep, 6 (33\%) participants use regexes 51+ times per year. Yet, regexes were rarely used in query languages like SQL. Upon further investigation, it turns out the surveyed developers were not on teams that dealt heavily with a database.

Table~\ref{tab:regexactivities} shows how frequently, on average, the participants use
regexes for various activities.
Participants answered questions using a 6-point likert scale including very frequently~(6), frequently~(5), occasionally~(4), rarely~(3), very rarely~(2), and never~(1).
Averaging across participants, among the most common usages are capturing parts of a string and locating content within a file, with both occurring somewhere between occasionally and frequently.

Using a similar 7-point likert scale that includes `always' as a seventh point, developers indicated that they test their regexes almost as frequently as they test their code (average response was 5.2, which is between frequently and very frequently).  Half of the  developers indicate that they use external tools to test their regexes, and the other half indicated that they only use tests that they write themselves. Of the nine developers using tools, six mentioned online composition aides such as \url{regex101.com} where a regex and input string are entered, and the input string is highlighted according to what is matched.

When asked an open ended question about pain points encountered with regular expressions, we observed three main categories. The most common, ``hard to compose," was represented in 61\% (11) responses. Next,
 39\% (7) developers responded that regexes are ``hard to read" and 17\% (3) indicated difficulties with ``inconsistency across implementations," which manifest when using regexes in multiple languages. These responses do not sum to 18 as three developers provided multiple parts in their answers.

\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Summary - RQ1:}
Common uses of regexes include locating content within a file, capturing parts of strings, and parsing user input.
The fact that all the surveyed developers compose regexes, and half of the developers use tools to test their regexes indicates the importance of tool development for regex.  Developers complain about regexes being hard to read and hard to write.

\input{table/saturation}

\subsection{RQ2: How  is the {\tt re} module used?}
We explore regex utilizations and flags used in the scraped Python projects.
Out of the \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value}\ projects scanned, \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentProjectsUsingRegex}{value}\% (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjectsUsingRegex}{value}) contained at least one regex utilization.  To illustrate how saturated projects are with regexes, we measure utilizations per project, files scanned per project, files contained utilizations, and  utilizations  per file, as shown in Table~\ref{table:saturation}.

Of projects containing at least one utilization, the average utilizations per project was 32 and the maximum  was 1,427.  The project with the most utilizations is a C\# project\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Ouroboros/Arianrhod}} that maintains a collection of source code for 20 Python libraries, including larger libraries like {\tt pip}, {\tt celery} and {\tt ipython}.  These larger Python libraries contain many utilizations.
From Table~\ref{table:saturation}, we also see that each project had an average of 11 files containing any utilization, and each of these files had an average of 2 utilizations.

\vspace{-6pt}
\label{fig:partFunctions}
\end{figure}

\input{table/featureStats}

The number of projects that use each of the {\tt re} functions is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:partFunctions}.  The y-axis denotes the total utilizations, with a maximum of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nUsages}{value}. The {\tt re.compile} function encompasses \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentCompile}{value}\% of all utilizations.
Note that compiled objects can also be used to call functions of the re module, ie {\tt compiledObject.findall(...)}, but we ignore these utilizations so that our analysis is easier to automate, and because we are primarily interested in extracting the patterns which these 8 functions contain.

Of all utilizations, \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentFlags0}{value}\% had no flag, or explicitly specified the default flag.  The debug flag, which causes the {\tt re} regex engine to display extra information about its parsing, was never observed. This may be because developers use it for debugging and choose not to commit it to their repositories.

\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Summary - RQ2:}
Only about half of the Python projects sampled contained any utilizations.  Most utilizations used the {\tt re.compile} function to compile a regex object before actually using the regex to find a match.  Most utilizations did not use a flag to modify matching behavior.

\subsection{RQ3: Regex language feature usage}
\label{results:rq3}

We  count the usages of each feature per project and as compared to all distinct regex patterns in the corpus.



\subsubsection{Feature Usage}
\label{sec:featureUsage}
Table~\ref{table:featureStats} displays feature usage from the corpus and relates it to four major regex related projects. Only features appearing in at least 10 projects are listed.
The first column, \emph{rank}, lists the rank of a feature (relative to other features) in terms of the number of projects in which it appears. The next column, \emph{code}, gives a succinct reference string for the feature, and is followed by a \emph{description} column that provides a brief comment on what the feature does.  The \emph{example} column provides a short example of how the feature can be used.
The next four columns, (i.e., \emph{brics}, \emph{hampi}, \emph{Rex}, and \emph{RE2}), map to the four major research projects chosen for our investigation (see Section~\ref{regextoolsresults}).  We indicate that a project supports a feature with the `\yes' symbol, and indicate that a project does not support the feature with the `\no' symbol.
The final four columns contain two pairs of usage statistics.  The first pair contains the number and percent of \emph{patterns} that a feature appears in, out of the 13,597 patterns that make up the corpus.  The second pair of columns contain the number and percent of \emph{projects} that a feature appears in out of the 1,645 projects scanned that contain at least one utilization.

One notable omission from Table~\ref{table:featureStats} is the literal feature, which is used  to specify matching any specific character.  An example pattern that contains only one literal token is the pattern \verb!`a'!.  This pattern only matches the lowercase letter `a'.  The literal feature was found in \DTLfetch{data}{key}{P_LITERAL_PRESENT}{value}\% of patterns.
We consider the literal feature to be necessary for any regex related tool to support, and so exclude it from Table~\ref{table:featureStats} and the rest of the feature analysis.



The eight most commonly used features, ADD, CG, KLE, CCC, ANY, RNG, STR and END,
appear in over half the projects.
CG is more commonly used in patterns than the highest ranked feature (ADD) by a wide margin (over 8\%), even though they appear in similar numbers of projects.

\subsubsection{Feature Support in Regex Tools}
\label{regextoolsresults}
While there are many regex tools available, in this work, we focus on the feature support for  four tools, brics, hampi, Rex and RE2, which offer diversity across developers (i.e., Microsoft, Google, open source, and academia) and applications. Further, as we wanted to perform a feature analysis, these four tools and their features are well-documented, allowing for easy comparison.

To create the tool mappings, we consulted documentation for each tool. For brics, we collected the set of supported features using the formal grammar\footnote{\url{http://www.brics.dk/automaton/doc/index.html?dk/brics/automaton/RegExp.html}}.  For hampi, we manually inspected the set of regexes included in the {\tt lib/regex-hampi/sampleRegex} file within the hampi repository\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/hampi/downloads/list}} (this may have been an overestimation, as this included more features than specified by the formal grammar\footnote{\url{http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/hampi/Grammar.html}}).  For RE2, we used the  supported feature documentation\footnote{\url{https://re2.googlecode.com/hg/doc/syntax.html}}.  For Rex, we collected the feature set empirically because we tried to parse all scraped patterns with Rex for the behavioral analysis (Section~\ref{rq4:results}), and Rex provides comprehensive error feedback for unsupported features.

Of the four projects selected for this analysis, RE2 supports the most studied features (28 features) followed by hampi (25 features),  Rex (21 features), and brics (12 features).  All projects support the 8 most commonly used features except brics, which does not support STR or END.
No projects support the four look-around features LKA, NLKA, LKB and NLKB.  RE2 and hampi support the LZY, NCG, PNG and OPT features, whereas brics and Rex do not.

\subsubsection{Survey Results for Feature Usage}
The pattern language for Python, which is used to compose regexes, supports default character classes like the ANY or dot character class: \verb!.! meaning, `any character except newline'.
It also supports three other default character classes: \verb!\d!, \verb!\w!, \verb!\s! (and their negations). All of these default character classes can be simulated using the custom character class (CCC) feature, which can create semantically equivalent regexes.
For example  the decimal character class: \verb!\d! is equivalent to a CCC containing all 10 digits:  \verb!\d! $\equiv$ \verb![0123456789]! $\equiv$ \verb![0-9]!.
Other default character classes such as the word character class: \verb!\w! may not be as intuitive to encode in a CCC: \verb![a-zA-Z0-9_]!.

Survey participants were asked if they use only CCC, use CCC more than default, use both equally, use default more than CCC or use only default.  Results for this question are shown in Table~\ref{tab:cccvsdefault}, with 67\% (12) indicating that they use default the most.
Participants who favored CCC indicated that ``it is more explicit," whereas the participants who favored default character classes said,  ``it is less verbose" and ``I like using built-in code."



\begin{table}
\caption{Survey results for preferences between custom character and default character classes (RQ3) \label{tab:cccvsdefault}}

use both equally & 2\\ \hline \bigstrut
use default more than CCC & 10\\ \hline \bigstrut
use only default & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vspace{-12pt}
\end{table}

To further explore how participants use various regex features, participants were asked five questions about how frequently they use specific related groups of features, chosen based on the tool feature support explored in Section~\ref{regextoolsresults}.
Results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:regexfeaturegroups}, indicating that lazy repetition and look-ahead features are rarely used and capture groups and endpoint anchors are occasionally to frequently used.


\begin{table}
\caption{Survey results for regex usage frequencies, averaged using a 6-point likert scale: Very Frequently=6, Frequently=5, Occasionally=4, Rarely=3, Very Rarely=2, and Never=1 (RQ3) \label{tab:regexfeaturegroups}}

\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{llc}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vspace{-12pt}
\end{table}



\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Summary - RQ3:}
The eight most common features are found in over 50\% of the projects.
Shown in Table~\ref{table:featureStats}, the STR and END features are present in over half of the scanned projects containing utilizations.  In our survey, over half (56\%) of the respondents answered that they use endpoint anchors frequently or very frequently, and none of them claimed to never use them.

The LZY feature  is present in over 36\% of scanned projects with utilizations, and yet was not supported by two of the four major regex projects we explored, brics and RE2.
In our developer survey, 11\% (2) of participants use this feature frequently and 6 (33\%) use it occasionally, showing a modest impact on potential users.
When survey participants were asked if they prefer to always use numbered (BKR) or named (BKRN) back references, 66\% (12) of survey participants said that they always use BKR, and the remaining 33\% (6) said ``it depends."  No participants preferred named capture groups.  BKR is present in 5\% of scanned projects, while BKRN is present in only 1.7\%, which corroborates our findings that numbered  are generally preferred over named capture groups.

\subsection{RQ4: Regex behavioral similarity}
\label{rq4:results}


In clustering the regular expressions, we are most interested in observing behavior of regexes found in multiple projects.  Starting with the 13,597 patterns of the corpus, we discarded 10,015 (74\%) patterns that were not found in multiple projects.
Then we excluded an additional 711 (5\%) patterns that contain features not supported by Rex.  We studied the remaining 2,871 (21\%) patterns using our similarity analysis technique. The impact is that 923 projects were excluded from the data set for the similarity analysis. Omitted features are indicated in Table~\ref{table:featureStats} for Rex.

From 2,871 distinct patterns, MCL clustering identified 186 clusters with 2 or more patterns, and 2,042 clusters of size 1.  The average size of clusters larger than size one was 4.5.  Each pattern belongs to exactly one cluster.

\input{table/exampleCluster}

Table~\ref{table:exampleCluster} provides an example of a behavioral cluster containing 12 patterns (four longer patterns omitted for brevity). Patterns from this cluster are present in 31 different projects.  All patterns in this cluster share the literal `:' character. The smallest pattern, \verb!`:+'!,  matches one or more colons.

We observe that the smallest pattern in a cluster provides insight about key characteristic that all the patterns in the cluster have in common.  A shorter pattern will tend to have less extraneous behavior because it is specifying less behavior,
yet, in order for the smallest pattern to be clustered, it had to match most of the strings created by Rex from many other patterns within the cluster, and so we observe that {the smallest pattern is useful as a representative of the cluster}.

For the rest of this paper, a cluster will be represented by one of the shortest patterns it contains, followed by the number of projects any member of the cluster appears in, so the cluster in Table~\ref{table:exampleCluster} will be represented as \verb!`:+'(31)!.  This representation is not an attempt to express all notable behavior of patterns within a cluster, but is a useful and meaningful abbreviation.
Other regexes in the cluster may exhibit more diverse behavior, for example the pattern \verb!`([^: ]+):(.*)'! requires a non-colon character to appear before a colon character.

We manually mapped the top 100 largest clusters based on the number of projects into 6 behavioral categories (determined by inspection).  The largest cluster was left out, as it was composed of patterns that trivially matched almost any string, like \verb!`b*'! and \verb!`^'!.  The remaining 99 clusters were all categorized. These clusters are briefly summarized in Table~\ref{tab:clustercats}, showing the name of the category and the number of clusters it represents, patterns in those clusters, and projects. The most common category is \emph{Multi Matches}, which contains clusters that have alternate behaviors (e.g., matching a comma or a semicolon, as in \verb!`,|;'(18)!). Each cluster was mapped to exactly one category. Next, we describe the categories, ordered by the number of projects the regex patterns map to.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{small}

\caption{Cluster categories and sizes (RQ4) \label{tab:clustercats}}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Clusters} & \textbf{Patterns} & \textbf{Projects} \\  \hline \bigstrut
Multi Matches & 21 & 237 & 295\\
\hline \bigstrut
Specific Char & 17 & 103 & 184\\
\hline \bigstrut
Anchored Patterns & 20 & 85 & 141\\
\hline \bigstrut

\hline \bigstrut
Two or More Chars & 16 & 40 & 120\\
\hline \bigstrut
Code Search & 15 & 27 & 92 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{-12pt}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\end{table}

%6
\subsubsection{Multiple Matching Alternatives}
The patterns in these clusters match under a variety of conditions by using a character class or a disjunctive \verb!|!.
For example:
\verb!`(\W)'(89)! matches any alphanumeric character, \verb!`(\s)'(89)! matches any whitespace character, \verb!`\d'(58)! matches any numeric character, and \verb!`,|;'(18)! matches a comma or semicolon.  Most of these clusters are represented by patterns that use default character classes, as opposed to custom character classes.  This provides further support for our survey results to the question, \emph{Do you prefer to use custom character classes or default character classes more often?}, in which a majority of participants indicated they use the default classes more than custom.

%5
\subsubsection{Specific Character Must Match}
\label{cluster:single}
Each cluster in this category requires one specific character to match, for example:
\verb!`\n\s*'(42)! matches only if a newline is found, \verb!`:+'(31)! matches only if a colon is found, \verb!`%'(22)!, matches only if a percent sign is found and \verb!`}'(14)! matches only if a right curly brace is found.
Table~\ref{table:exampleCluster} presents a cluster that falls under this category.
The commonality of this cluster category contrasts with the survey in Section~\ref{rq1:survey} in which participants reported to very rarely or never use regexes to check for a single character (Table~\ref{tab:regexactivities}).

%3
\subsubsection{Anchored Patterns}
Each of the clusters uses at least one endpoint anchor to require matches to be absolutely positioned, for example:
\verb!`(\w+)$'(35)! captures the word characters at the end of the input, \verb!`^\s'(16)! matches a whitespace at the beginning of the input, and \verb!`^-?\d+$'(17)! requires that the entire input is an (optionally negative) integer.
These anchors are the only way in regexes to guarantee that a character does (or does not) appear at a particular location by specifying what is allowed. As an example, \verb!^[-_A-Za-z0-9]+$! says that from beginning to end, only \verb![-_A-Za-z0-9]! characters are allowed, so it will fail to match if undesirable characters, such as \verb!?!, appear anywhere in the string.

%2
\subsubsection{Content of Brackets and Parenthesis}
\label{cluster:contentparens}
The clusters in this category center around finding a pair of characters that surround content, often also capturing that content. For example,
\verb!`\(.*\)'(29)! matches when content is surrounded by parentheses and \verb!`".*"'(25)! matches  when content is surrounded by double quotes.  The cluster \verb!`<(.+)>'(23)! matches and captures content surrounded by angled brackets.

%4
\subsubsection{Two or More Characters in Sequence}
\label{cluster:multiple}
These clusters require several characters in a row to match some pattern, for example:
\verb!`\d+\.\d+'(30)! requires one or more digits followed by a period character, followed by one or more digits.  The cluster \verb!`  '(17)! requires two spaces in a row, and \verb!`@[a-z]+'(9)! requires the at symbol followed by two or more lowercase characters, as in a twitter handle.

%1
\subsubsection{Code Search and Variable Capturing}
\label{cluster:search}
These clusters show a recognizable effort to parse source code or URLs. For example,
\verb!`^https?://'(23)! matches a web address, and \verb!`(.+)=(.+)'(9)! matches an assignment statement, capturing both the variable name and value.
The cluster  \verb!`\$\{([\w\-]+)\}'(11)! matches an evaluated string interpolation and captures the code to evaluate.

\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Summary - RQ4:}
We identified six main categories that define regex behavior at a high level: matching with alternatives, matching literal characters, matching with sequences, matching with endpoint anchors, parsing contents of brackets or braces, or searching and capturing code.
