\subsection{Frequency of Regex \emph{Utilizations} in Python Projects}
\subsubsection{Saturation of Projects with Regex \emph{Utilizations}}
Out of the \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value}\ projects scanned, \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentProjectsUsingRegex}{value}\% (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjectsUsingRegex}{value}) contained at least one \emph{utilization}.  For context about how saturated these projects were with regex \emph{utilizations}, we consider how many files the average project scanned contained, how many of those files contained \emph{utilizations}, and how many \emph{utilizations} occurred per file in table~\ref{table:contextHistogram}.

\subsubsection{Usage Frequency of {\tt re} Module Functions and Flags}

\caption{How often are the 8 re functions used? (RQ1)}
\label{fig:partFunctions}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:partFunctions} The `compile' function encompasses \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentCompile}{value}\% of all \emph{utilizations}, presumably because each usage of those functions could accept the compiled regex as an argument.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../analysis_output/partFlags.eps}
\caption{Which behavioral flags are used? (RQ1)}
\label{fig:partFlags}
\end{figure}

When considering flag use, we excluded non-behavioral flags (default and debug), which account for \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentFlags0}{value}\% of all \emph{utilizations}.

 As shown in figure ~\ref{fig:partFlags}, of all behavioral flags used, ignorecase (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentI}{value}\%) and multiline (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentM}{value}\%) were the most frequently used.  It is also worth noting that although multiple flags can be combined using a bitwise or, this was never observed.

\subsection{Frequency of Feature Usage}

Literal tokens were found in \DTLfetch{data}{key}{P_LITERAL_PRESENT}{value}\% of patterns, and accounted for \DTLfetch{data}{key}{P_LITERAL_TOKENS}{value}\% of all tokens.  We consider literal tokens to be ubiquitous in all \emph{utilizations}, and necessary for any regex related tool, and so exclude them from the rest of the feature analysis.  In table~\ref{table:featureStats}, we display a large body of information about feature usage and relate it to four major regex related projects.

\subsection{What Features Are Used For}


% TODO - multiple boxplots for all 5-6 demonstrating cluster size and then also have \# of clusters, pick smallest number of clusters and then use that.


tell them how the cluster groups in the first part are all drawn from a subset of the corpus limited by what Rex can support, whereas the cluster groups in the second part are all drawn from the complete corpus, but are not guaranteed to have behavioral similarity like in the first part.


%whereas each group in the second part is drawn from a subset of strings in the corpus known to contain at least one of the desired features.  We did this because the presence of a feature in a pattern can be easily lost
