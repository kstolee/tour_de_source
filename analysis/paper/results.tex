\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present the results of each research question. 

\subsection{RQ1: How  is the {\tt re} module used in Python projects?}
To address this research question, we look at regex utilizations, flags, and the overlap among pattern strings among utilizations. 

\subsubsection{Saturation of Projects with Utilizations}
Out of the \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value}\ projects scanned, \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentProjectsUsingRegex}{value}\% (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjectsUsingRegex}{value}) contained at least one regex utilization.  For context about how saturated these projects were with utilizations, we consider how many utilizations were observed per project, how many files the average project scanned contained, how many of those files contained utilizations, and how many utilizations occurred per file in Table~\ref{table:saturation}.

The average regex utilizations per project was 32, but this is offset by a high maximum value of 1,427. This value appeared in a project that \todo{finish this sentence}. The average number of files containing a utilization was 11 out of the average total files per project of 53. On average, each file with a regex utilization had only two, with a median of 1. 


From Table~\ref{table:saturation}, we see that on average each project had \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medRFilePerProj}{value} files containing any regex usage, out of an average of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medFilePerProj}{value} files.  Each of the files that did have a regex usage had an average of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medRPerFile}{value} regex usages.  Because we scanned \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value} projects, we would expect to have seen \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nExpectedUsages}{value} regex usages, which is lower than the actual \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nUsages}{value} usages observed.

\subsubsection{Usage Frequency of {\tt re} Module Functions}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../analysis_output/partFlags.eps}
\caption{Which behavioral flags are used? (RQ1)}
\label{fig:partFlags}
\end{figure}

The number of projects that use each of the {\tt re} modules are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:partFunctions}.  The y-axis denotes the total utilizations, with a maximum of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nUsages}{value}. The {\tt re.compile} function encompasses \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentCompile}{value}\% of all utilizations, presumably because each usage of those functions could accept the compiled regex as an argument. 

\subsubsection{Usage Frequency of {\tt re} Module Flags}
When considering flag use, we excluded non-behavioral flags (default and debug), which account for \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentFlags0}{value}\% of all utilizations. \todo{are they both present in debug and default? how much of the 87\% is for each omitted flag? Why are these omitted, again?}

 As shown in figure ~\ref{fig:partFlags}, of all behavioral flags used, ignorecase (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentI}{value}\%) and multiline (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentM}{value}\%) were the most frequently used.  It is also worth noting that although multiple flags can be combined using a bitwise or, this was never observed.

\subsection{RQ2: Which regular expression language features are most commonly used in python?}
Table~\ref{table:featureStats}  lists all the regex features observed in at least 10 projects. 
The first column, \emph{rank}, lists the features in order of popularity, determined by the percentage of projects in which they appear. The next column, \emph{code}, gives a succinct reference string for the feature followed by a {\tt description} and {\tt example} usage from the corpus. For example, the most common feature observed in the corpus is the {\tt +} token, denoting \emph{one-or-more repetition}s, and is abbreviated {\tt ADD}. 
After the tool mapping (see Section~\ref{results:rq3}), the usage statistics are presented for the number and percent of patterns that the feature appears in, the number and percent of total files in which the appears at least once, and the number and percent of total projects in which that feature appears at least once. 

Literal tokens were found in \DTLfetch{data}{key}{P_LITERAL_PRESENT}{value}\% of patterns, and accounted for \DTLfetch{data}{key}{P_LITERAL_TOKENS}{value}\% of all tokens.  We consider literal tokens to be ubiquitous in all utilizations, and necessary for any regex related tool, and so exclude them from the rest of the feature analysis.  In table~\ref{table:featureStats}, we display a large body of information about feature usage and relate it to four major regex related projects. \todo{needs more complete description of feature usage}

	\subsection{{RQ3:} What is the impact of \emph{not} supporting various regular expression features on tool designers and users?}
	\label{results:rq3}

We guide the results analysis for this research question based on the features \emph{not} supported by popular regex tools. 
Table~\ref{table:featureStats} shows the mapping from features to regex tools.
The mappings for each regex tool to the features are shown using \yes $ $ to denote when 
a feature is supported by the tool and \no $ $ when it is not. 




% TODO - multiple boxplots for all 5-6 demonstrating cluster size and then also have \# of clusters, pick smallest number of clusters and then use that.
%(I think it's more complicated than that, perhaps we can link to my discussion about how I explored the space to find the best i, p, k values)

Our behavioral clustering technique found 952 clusters over 2727 patterns, with at least one cluster present in 999 of the 9727 projects that were compatible with Rex.

\todo{Need to know why MCL is behaving like this}

Table~\ref{table:exampleCluster} provides an example of a smaller behavioral cluster, representing 13 patterns, with at least one pattern from this cluster present in 100 different projects.
\input{../behavioral_clustering/exampleCluster}
On first glance this cluster may seem to revolve around the `\verb!\s*!' parts of these patterns, but actually this cluster was formed because each of these patterns has a comma literal, and other details did not interfere with matching the Rex-generated strings with commas in them.

It is not a coincidence that the smallest pattern in this cluster gives the best idea of what all the patterns within it have in common (the smallest pattern is just the single comma character, at index 1).  All of the clusters we found follow this trend: the shortest pattern describes the rest of the pattern's behavior very well.  In table~\ref{table:topNClusters}, I show the top 10 clusters, ranked by the number of projects they appear in, using the shortest pattern from the cluster as an example.
The cluster in Table~\ref{table:exampleCluster} appears in the seventh row of Table~\ref{table:topNClusters}.

\input{../behavioral_clustering/topNClusters}

\subsubsection{Feature Groups Overview}
Instead of analyzing every feature independently, we chose small groups of conceptually related features.  For each of these groups, we selected all clusters that had at least one of the features in at least one pattern within the cluster to form a `feature group'-focused cluster set.

Table~\ref{table:featureGroups} shows the total number of projects that contain at least one pattern from at least one cluster in the cluster set, and some selected clusters represented by the shortest string in the cluster.  These clusters were selected not because of being within the largest number of projects, but because they illustrate some interesting usage of a feature that will be explored in detail later.

\input{../behavioral_clustering/featureGroups}


(note that for the ANY group, all but two of the top 30 clusters used `.*', but that .* as a pattern alone only appeared in 23 projects)


tell them how the cluster groups in the first part are all drawn from a subset of the corpus limited by what Rex can support, whereas the cluster groups in the second part are all drawn from the complete corpus, but are not guaranteed to have behavioral similarity like in the first part.


\todo{Insert summary of results for RQ3}
%whereas each group in the second part is drawn from a subset of strings in the corpus known to contain at least one of the desired features.  We did this because the presence of a feature in a pattern can be easily lost
