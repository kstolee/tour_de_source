\subsection{Context and Corpus}

\subsubsection{Saturation}Although \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentProjectsUsingRegex}{value}\% of the projects observed had at least one regex usage, only \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentFilesUsingRegex}{value}\% of the files observed had at least one regex usage.

%rather than let datatool construct the table, insert a custom table
%\input{../analysis_output/contextHistogram}

From the above figure/table, we see that on average each project had \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medRFilePerProj}{value} files containing any regex usage, out of an average of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medFilePerProj}{value} files.  Each of the files that did have a regex usage had an average of \DTLfetch{data}{key}{medRPerFile}{value} regex usages.  Because we scanned \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nProjScanned}{value} projects, we would expect to have seen \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nExpectedUsages}{value} regex usages, which is lower than the actual \DTLfetch{data}{key}{nUsages}{value} usages observed.

\subsubsection{Regex Functions and Flags}

\label{fig:partFunctions}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:partFunctions} The `compile' function encompasses \DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentCompile}{value}\% of all usages, even though every compiled regex object can only be used by calling other functions.  (TODO-Why?)

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../analysis_output/partFlags.eps}
\caption{Which behavioral flags are used?}
\label{fig:digraph}
\end{figure}

\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentFlags0}{value}\% of all regex usages did not use a flag or specified a non-behavioral flag (default or debug).  Of all behavioral flags used, ignorecase (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentI}{value}\%) and multiline (\DTLfetch{data}{key}{percentM}{value}\%) were the most frequently used.  It is also worth noting that although multiple flags can be combined using a bitwise or, this was never observed. (remove this last part if it is observed later)

\subsubsection{{GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REGEXES FOUND}}

\subsubsection{{Top 10 Regex Patterns by weight}}

\subsubsection{All Features}

Literal tokens were found in (TODO) 101\% of patterns, and accounted for 75\% of all tokens.  Excluding literal tokens and features that were not present in any pattern, the following stats...make a sentence, these are some stats about the features:

OK now that is all for section 2.  Now in section 3 I want to look at clustering by string similarity using mcl clustering algorithm.  Here are the top 6 clusters using various string similarity metrics:

TODO - multiple boxplots for all 5-6 demonstrating cluster size and then also have \# of clusters, pick smallest number of clusters and then use that.
