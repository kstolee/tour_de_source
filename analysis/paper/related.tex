\section{Motivation and Related Work}
\label{sec:motivation}
Bugs related to regular expressions are common, resulting in tens of thousands of bug reports~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207}.

\section{Motivation}

With regexes, there is a common saying: 'now you have two problems'.
A skilled programmer can quickly solve many problems using regular expressions, but they can be hard to understand and maintain[back me up somebody - joke guy].
Regular expression languages enable an irreplaceable search technique used within all kinds of text editors and command line tools.
Regexes are also employed in critical missions like mysql injection prevention , malicious packet filtering  and web form validation.

Tools like Hampi, Kudzu, brics\footnote{\url{http://www.brics.dk/automaton/}}, Microsoft's Rex, Automata and the z3-based QF\_VRE projects, all attempt to support modeling some subset of regular expression language features.
To improve test coverage for code using regular expressions, and to generate strings from regular expressions for whatever other reasons, projects like Reggae, Rex, JST, regex-tester\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nickawatts/regex-tester}}, regldg\footnote{\url{http://regldg.com/}},
uttool\footnote{\url{http://uttool.com/text/regexstr/default.aspx}}, xeger\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/xeger/}}, Generex\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mifmif/Generex}}, Hoa/Regex\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hoaproject/Regex/}}, Genex\footnote{\url{http://search.cpan.org/~bowmanbs/Regexp-Genex-0.07/lib/Regexp/Genex.pm}}, Randexp\footnote{\url{https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/randexp}}, txt2re\footnote{\url{http://txt2re.com/}}, Pex\footnote{\url{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/}} have been developed.
Going the other direction, many projects attempt to take a set of strings and generate a good regular expression that matches them like RegexGenerator++\footnote{\url{http://regex.inginf.units.it/}}, ,Regex-PreSuf\footnote{\url{http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/Regex-PreSuf-1.17/PreSuf.pm}}.
Countless research papers have focused on various other regular expression-related investigations, too many to list.

One common misconception is that all regular expression languages can be represented using finite state automata.  Some regular expression languages

But most regular expression languages are not just regular languages that can be represented by finite state automata anymore, they have .  In many regular expression languages

%Tools to help developers write correct regular expressions, tools like RegexBuddy, Expresso, Pythex, The Regex Coach, Regex Widget, Regex magic, RegE xr, reWork, Rubular, Txt2re and....




\subsection{Research on Regular Expressions}
Visual debugging of regular expressions~\cite{Beck:2014:RVD:2591062.2591111}

%the related work section in the Spishak section is very good re: regex tools like those that represent regexes as automata or grammars
Static analysis to reduce errors in building regular expressions by using a type system to identify errors like {\tt PatternSyntaxExceptions} and {\tt IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions} at compile time~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207}.
