\section{Motivation and Related Work}
\label{sec:motivation}
Bugs related to regular expressions are common, resulting in tens of thousands of bug reports~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207}.

With regexes, there is a common saying 'now you have two problems'



\subsection{Research on Regular Expressions}
Visual debugging of regular expressions~\cite{Beck:2014:RVD:2591062.2591111}

%the related work section in the Spishak section is very good re: regex tools like those that represent regexes as automata or grammars
Static analysis to reduce errors in building regular expressions by using a type system to identify errors like {\tt PatternSyntaxExceptions} and {\tt IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions} at compile time~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207}.

\subsection{Research that Depends on Regular Expression Usage}
Regular expressions are used as queries in a data mining framework~\cite{Begel:2010:CDE:1806799.1806821}
