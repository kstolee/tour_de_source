\begin{abstract}
Regular expressions are used frequently in many programming languages for form validation,
ad-hoc file searches, and simple parsing. Given their popularity, many researchers have focused on
making regular expressions easier to build, understand, and use. Yet, there does not exist a study of
regular expression feature usage and diversity. In this paper, we explore how often regular expressions are used, which language features are most common, and how syntactically and semantically similar regular expressions are to one another. To do this, we scraped 2 million open source Python projects from GitHub and explored the regular expressions contained within. Our results indicate that \todo{high level results}
