\section{Survey}
\label{sec:survey}

To understand the context of when and how programmers use regular expressions,
we designed a survey with 40 questions about regex usage. This survey was
deployed to developers at Dwolla, a company that provides software for
 online and mobile payment management.
 \todoLast{they are probably ok with using their name - check during final scrub by Dwolla}
Participation was voluntary and participants were entered in a lottery for a \$50 gift card.
The survey was completed by 18 participants that identified as software developer/maintainers who had used regular expressions in a work environment.


On average, survey participants report to compose 172 regexes per year ($\sigma$ = 250) and compose regexes on average once per month, with 27\% composing multiple regexes in a week and an additional 22\% composing regexes once per week.
Table~\ref{tab:regexenviron} shows how frequently participants compose regexes using each of several languages and technical environments.
Six (33\%) of the survey participants report to compose regexes using general purpose programming languages (e.g., Java, C, C\#) 1-5 times per year and 5 (28\%) do this 6-10 times per year.  Regexes were rarely used in query languages like SQL, but for command line usage in tools such as grep, 6 (33\%) participants use regexes 51+ times per year. Overall, regexes are used frequently, but in some environments, such as command line or text editor, and sometimes query languages, the composed regular expressions do not persist.

Table~\ref{tab:regexactivities} shows how frequently, on average, the participants use
regexes for various actives.
Participants answered questions using a 6-point likert scale including very frequently, frequently, occasionally, rarely, very rarely, and never.
Assigning values from 1 to 6, where 6 is the most frequent, the responses were averaged across participants.
Among the most common are capturing parts of a string and locating content within a file, with both occurring somewhere between occasionally and frequently. \todoMid{summary message}
