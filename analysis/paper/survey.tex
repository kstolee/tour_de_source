\section{Survey}
\label{sec:survey}

To understand the context of when and how programmers use regular expressions, 
we designed a survey with \todo{X} questions about regex usage. This survey was 
deployed to developers at Dwolla, a company that provides software for
 online and mobile payment management. 
 \todo{does the company want to be named in the
paper?} 
Participation was voluntary and participants were entered in a lottery for a \$50 gift card. 
The survey was completed by 20 participants. Two survey responses were excluded
because \todo{why?}, leaving 18 responses in the final data set.
